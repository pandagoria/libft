# Libft
Your very first own library

  This project is about understanding the way standard C functions work, implementing and learning to use them.
  
  Project contains a recoded set of functions from the libc. They have the same prototypes, implement the same behaviors as the originals and comply with the way they are defined in their man.
  
  Moreover, a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form, is developed as well.
